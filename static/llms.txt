# ShelfLife

> ShelfLife is a free, offline-first Progressive Web App for organizing board game collections, deciding what to play, logging plays, and viewing analytics.

## About

ShelfLife helps board gamers manage their physical game collections digitally. Users can add games manually or import from BoardGameGeek, filter by player count and playing time, use an animated dice-roll randomizer to pick games for game night, log play sessions with winner tracking, and view stats and insights about their gaming habits.

The app works offline — your collection lives on your device (IndexedDB via Dexie.js) and syncs to the cloud (Supabase) when connected. It's installable as a PWA on phones and desktops.
